## Android Course Manager

Android course manager made as part of a group project.

 This course manager helps students in planning their academic courses efficiently by creating a timeline based on prerequisites, session offerings, and the user's preferences. The app allows two types of users: admins who specify course offerings and prerequisites, and students who generate timelines by providing the list of courses they want to take and those they have already taken
